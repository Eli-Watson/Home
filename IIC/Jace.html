    <h1>The Jace Index</h1>
    <p>This is a paper outlining and debating the new breakthroughs in Multiple-people-but-really-in-one-person disorder. this disorder is commonly mistaken with Dissociative identity disorder, Also known as Multiple Personality Disorder, but Multiple-people-but-really-in-one-person disorder is completely different as each personality is based on the name Jase, regardless of their real name. We have currently only found one test subject experiencing this phenomena but we feel that is sufficient to (attempt) to write a 6,000 word dissertation on the subject thanks to out extensive evidence provided by the subject on such matters. We have complied and procured a list of such personality's which we will include below for posterity.
    </p>
    <p>Edit 1: After more time and testing we have determined that the extra personalities are not limited to only jase names. We now understand that these names only have to start with a j or g and contain a c, s, or x within it. The rules listed below concerning gender still apply.</p>
    <ins>Note: Names listed with the suffix "ina" designate a female while those without it are males.</ins>
