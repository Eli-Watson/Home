        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>My Name is Eli Watson. Here is some quick facts about me first, and then a more detailed explanation about me and this site below.</p>
        <ul>
            <p>Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior.</p>
            <p>I live in the Southern part of the United States Of America.</p>
            <p>I like Computers, Ham and CB Radio, the outdoors, Camping, Fishing, Hunting, Airsoft, and Knives to name a few.</p>
            <p>I am a Boy Scout, and Brotherhood Honor member of The Order Of The Arrow. WWW.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>
            That's the quick facts about me, now some info about this site. I started coding websites on Google Sites, and at that point there was no code involed, I 
            used it like a site builder, eventually I learned you could put "real" website code into it, and I learned the basics of html on W3S.org and 
            "built" my first website. I then Started looking around for a better place to host my code, and stumbled into Github pages,
            and evrey site I have built from then on has been hosted on Github Pages for free. This Site you are looking at right now was initally just another 
            one of those projects, until it became somthing I could acctually put projects and such onto. I started looking around for some way to host articles on github, as 
            writing evrey page in html manually is tedious. After some reserch I relized that you could host a Hugo site on github and promply set one up, that is what my article site still runs on.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have done my best to keep any contriversial opinions off this site, as that is not the point of it, but I will say this:
            I belive in right to repair, The Second Ammendment, the Constitution, and The right to bear arms. These should not really contriversial but they are.
