                        <p>This is a python tool I made to interactively generate graphs using telemetry data provided

                        <p>A Hugo theme I made for use on my own website. It's super simple (no js) and looks kinda like
                            the "classic" web.</p>
                        <p>Features:</p>

                            <p>Super Light Weight</p>
                            <p>Looks like the "Classic Web"</p>

                <h2>All of my Websites...</h2>
                <p>Ok... So my fist foray into programming was making dumb websites with html and css,
                    eventually I learned a little bit of JS and here we are now. Below are some of the websites I have
                    made
                    over the years and stuff. Sidenote: Just made my fist python application (above) and I really liked
                    it. Might see more of those in the future.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://eli-watson.github.io/Home/">Home</a> <a href="https://github.com/Eli-Watson/Home"(>GitHub repo)</a>
                        <p>We have to start with this one. First GitHub repo I ever made, started as a simple index.html file and became
                        whatever this is, parts of it is are dumpster fires (don't look at darkmode.js or custom.js) but it is still my main and largest site.
                            it even gets updated from time to time.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://eli-watson.github.io/Retro/"></a> <a href="https://github.com/Eli-Watson/Retro">(GitHub Repo)</a>
                        <p>First of my side projects after I started the Dumpster fire that is /Home/. Hasn't been updated
                        since I made it, was created because I was tired of the main sites colors. It does have some cool Javascript RSS stuff.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://eli-watson.github.io/">Article Site</a> <a href="https://github.com/Eli-Watson/eli-watson.github.io">(GitHub Repo)</a>
                        <p>Probably the best site I have ever built.. mostly became I didn't write most of it. Its a Hugo Site with a theme I custom made
                        Hosts all my writings, blog, articles, etc. Kinda looks like /Retro/ unintentionally.</p>

                        <p>Ok, this one is kinda random. It's an IOS Web App with a three.js background, too much flexbox and random features. Works on both desktop and mobile but ment for the latter.</p>
