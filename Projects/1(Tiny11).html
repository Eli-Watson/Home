        <h1>Tiny 11 On a dell Latitude E4510 (and other things)</h1>
        <p>So I had this old Dell E5410 that was just sitting on a shelf collecting dust. And I had just discovered a moddified version of win11 called Tin11. So it only seemed natural for me to try and install one on the other.
        But fist of all the specs:</p>
      <h2>Laptop Specifications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Processor: Intel Core i5-450M</li>
        <li>Memory: 8GB DDR3L 1600 CL11 RAM</li>
        <li>Storage: 128GB SSD</li>
        <li>Wireless: Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6235</li>
    </ul>    
       <p>So with that out of the way lest get into the installation: I had no issues. Its a first for me but this time when installing the os it went smoothly and without hickus, besides declining all of microsoft's ai features.
       I have linked a video I made that outlines preformance testing using cinebench.</p>
