        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>My Name is Eli Watson. Here is some quick facts about me first, and then a more detailed explanation about me
            and this site below.</p>
        <ul>
            <p>Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior.</p>
            <p>I live in the Southern part of the United States Of America.</p>
            <p>I like Computers, Amature and CB Radio, the outdoors, Camping, Fishing, Hunting, Airsoft, and Knives to name
                a few.</p>
            <p>I am a Boy Scout, and Brotherhood Honor member of The Order Of The Arrow. WWW.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>
            That's the quick facts about me, now some info about this site. I started coding websites on Google Sites,
            and at that point there was no code involved, I
            used it like a site builder, eventually I learned you could put "real" website code into it, and I learned
            the basics of html on W3S.org and
            "built" my first website. I then Started looking around for a better place to host my code, and stumbled
            into GitHub pages,
            and evrey site I have built from then on has been hosted on GitHub Pages for free. This Site you are looking
            at right now was initially just another
            one of those projects, until it became something I could actually put projects and such onto. I started
            looking around for some way to host articles on GitHub, as
            writing evrey page in html manually is tedious. After some research I realized that you could host a Hugo site
            on GitHub and promptly set one up, that is what my article site still runs on.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have done my best to keep any controversial opinions off this site, as that is not the point of it, but I
            will say this:
            I believe that Jesus Christ is the Messiah. I believe in The Constitution. I believe in the need and right to bear arms.
